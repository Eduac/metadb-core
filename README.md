# MetaDB-Core
[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/LafColDevs/metadb-core.png)](http://travis-ci.org/LafColDevs/metadb-core)

This is a Node.js application which comprises the MetaDB web service. 
Note: This is not a stand-alone application. A JSON-RPC speaking front end is required to interface with MetaDB Core.
MetaDB UI (https://github.com/LafColDevs/metadb) is a UI layer in ExpressJS.

MetaDB Core uses PostgreSQL as its database due to the nature of heavy relationships it carries.
