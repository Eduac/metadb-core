[nf0001] Taiwan,台湾の風光 [Taiwan no fūkō̄],214 PUBLISHING;,"The author, date, and place of publication are missing from the two copies of this book at hand. The album digitized herein is in the editor's possession; the other was borrowed from Stanford University via interlibrary loan for purposes of comparison. The bibliographic information in Stanford's on-line catalog [incorrectly] estimates the date of publication at 1931 (the album contains printed dates from 1933 and 1938). The Stanford Library database does not identify the editor. However, the Stanford database identifies Yamazaki Kin'ichirō 山崎鋆一郎 as editor of _Taiwan no tenbō (1932)_ . According to the Japanese National Diet Library database, both of these pictorial works were edited by the same man, Yamazaki Kaneichirō 山崎〓一郎 (the symbol 〓 represents a non-standard character; the NDL database does not indicate the actual character). The NDL reads Yamazaki's personal name as """"Kane'ichirō"""" カネイチロウ, in contrast to Stanford's reading Kin'ichirō.  The reading of 鋆 is 'kane' according to the _新大字典_ (p. 2405). However, this same character is read as 'kin' according to the _漢字源_ (Casio Ex-word). Because the _漢字源_ gives an explicit 人名 (personal name) reading for 鋆, we are using the Stanford reading, """"Kin'ichiro.""""  The date-of-publication is 1934 in the NDL entry, which is plausible for the Stanford University copy of this album, which contains no marks or stamps more recent than 1933. However, the version digitized herein includes censor's permits, burned into the negatives, that are dated 1938. Significantly, these items marked 1938 (four total) are not included in the Stanford copy. The later edition's four missing images were of an airbase in Pingdong, an aerial view of Gaoxiong City, a bridge in Pingdong, and a loading dock in Gaoxiong Harbor. These may have been removed from the later edition due to concerns about national security in the wake of the Marco Polo Bridge incident of 1937. Apparently, images from Gaoxiong, a vital port city, were sensitive to Japanese authorities. These four censored images, and the map from the earlier edition, have been scanned and appended, with appropriate citations. Based on the 1938 censor's stamps, we estimate the date of publication for the album digitized herein as 1939, assuming an interval between the vetting of materials and publication similar to that of the Stanford/Hoover Institute copy.",,,,,,Taiwan;,,Printed page,,"Yamazaki Kinichiro, editor",,,,Ikegami Naoko;,circa 1939,,,,,,186,59 leaves ; 14 x 20 cm,Colonial Pictorial Works;East Asia Image Collection;Scenic Taiwan,Master TIF image captured at 4000 pixels across the long edge using SilverFast AI 6 software and an Epson 4990 scanner.

[nf0004] [Preface],巻頭に,214 PUBLISHING;,Preface to the photo collection,"Taiwanese history is extremely new. Until the Dutch occupied the island in 1624, it was mostly left to the mercies of savages, and as such, this orphaned island served as a stronghold for pirates in some places, and a landing place for ships in distress. Around 1600 the name Taiwan was born from a corruption of the local language, a name without any meaning. Nevertheless, Taiwan has been connected to Japan since times of old: Hideyoshi invited the islanders to pay tribute; the Vermilion Seal ships crossed to Taiwan; Hamada Yahyoe's heroic exploits [occured there]; and, Taiwan was occupied by Zheng Chenggong, whose mother was Japanese. Moreover, in 1871, Ryukyu islanders accidentally drifted ashore and were massacred, bringing about a debate regarding a punitive expedition. As a result, Commander Saigo, an advocate of action, led the Taiwan Expedition. Taiwan at long last became Japanese territory in 1895. Since then, some 40-odd years have passed. Hurriedly, every effort was made at construction, so that now the whole island's face has been made anew, in terms of education, transportation, industry, and sanitation. The savages, who clung to strange and unbelievable customs in the old days, have been reformed and pacified; they have in every way left savagery behind. In addition, the scourge of malaria has been defeated; one can say it is a remnant of the past. In addition, Taiwan boasts an abundance of double-cropped rice, mountains of sugar-producing cane, camphor, and [the island] is rich in timber, etc. Such rare fruits as pineapple and bananas grow naturally and plentifully.  The beauty of water carved cliffs gladdens the eyes of all who seem them; the highest mountain peaks under heaven are on Mt. Niitaka; the hard-to-describe inspirational qualities of Sun Moon Lake; not to mention the castles built by the Dutch, Spanish and Chinese. A tropical country of eternal summer, the island of Hourai, a South Seas paradise, where visitors are welcomed with open arms. Oh you people, come on! Won't you all come and take in such pleasures? Fortunately, for the sake of all, this album appears in miniature, perhaps as a companion. Though we claim a small measure of achievement, we regret that many shortcomings remain and we beg the reader's indulgence.",台湾の歴史は極めて新しい。西暦千六百二十四年和蘭が領有するまで、殆ど南海の一孤島として、蕃人の割拠に委し或る所は海賊の根拠地となり、難波船の漂着地となってゐたその台湾の名も千六百年頃土人語の轉訛より生まれたものとされ、何等意味なきものである。 　然し我国としては秀吉が入貢を勧めるあり、御朱印船の渡航あり、又濱田彌兵衛の武勇談あり、日本人を母とする鄭成功の領台等あ��、可なり古くから相関連したものがあった。而も明治四年偶々琉球人の漂着して惨殺された事件により、征討の論起り、出師の議熟して西郷都督の台湾征伐となった。其後幾多の曲折を経て明治二十八年遂にわが領土となり爾来四十有余年、鋭意その建設を急ぎ、今や教育に、交通に、産業に、衛生に、あらゆる施設を全うして、全島の風物は劃然としてその面目を一新した。 　その昔、あらぬ習慣や奇習に狂喜した蕃人は、悉く帰順してその風を矯め、事毎に野蛮の域を脱しつつある。又台湾に行くものは必ず罹厄の難に遭うものとされたマラリア病は、既にその矛をおさめて久しく、昔語りとさえなりつつある。又年二期に亙って収穫される豊穣な米、砂糖をはじめ山なす甘蔗、樟脳、木材等盛んにして、パインアップル、バナナ等の珍果、天恵潤して��りある。殊に人々の眼を喜ばす水成岩の美、天下一の高峰新高や、情趣そぞろの日月潭、或は西班牙、和蘭、支那の相倶に築いた城もあって、熱帯の気濃やかな常夏の国、蓬莱の島、而して南海の楽土は、旅する者を双手を挙げて歓迎してゐる。おお、人々よ行け！人々よ行ってその楽しさを享けんか。 　幸いにもこの小さきアルバムが皆様の為にその一片の資となり、或は伴侶となり、僅かながらでも齎らすところあれば.......と思いつつも尚足らざること多き憾みに、只管皆様の御寛恕を乞う。,,,,Taiwan;,,Printed page,,"Yamazaki Kinichiro, editor",,,,Ikegami Naoko;,circa 1939,,,,,,171,59 leaves ; 14 x 20 cm,Colonial Pictorial Works;East Asia Image Collection;Scenic Taiwan,Master TIF image captured at 4000 pixels across the long edge using SilverFast AI 6 software and an Epson 4990 scanner.
